# Mobile Responsiveness

- Use CSS flexbox or grid for responsive layout
- Collapse two-column layout to single column on small screens
- Stack prompt input above example prompts table on mobile
- Lights remain visible and centered on all screen sizes
- Use MUI's responsive utilities or media queries for breakpoints
- Ensure all buttons and inputs are touch-friendly
