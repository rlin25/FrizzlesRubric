# UI Layout and Routing

- Single page application (SPA) with main route '/'
- Main layout: two-column flexbox
  - Left column: prompt input form, submit button, and visual feedback (lights)
  - Right column: example prompts table with drag-and-drop
- Header with app title
- Footer with minimal info
- Use React Router if additional routes are needed in the future
