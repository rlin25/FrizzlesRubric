# Objective
- Develop a large language model (LLM) capable of differentiating between proper and improper grammar/spelling in English prompts.
    - The model should accept a prompt string as input and output a binary classification (proper/improper) with a confidence score.
    - The system is intended for automated evaluation of prompt grammar in internal tools.
    - No requirement for human-in-the-loop or manual review in the workflow.
