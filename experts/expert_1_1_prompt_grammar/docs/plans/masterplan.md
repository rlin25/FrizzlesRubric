# Master Plan: Expert 1.1 Prompt Grammar

This document provides a high-level overview of the Prompt Grammar expert system, summarizing the purpose and approach of each component in the project. For implementation details, refer to the corresponding subplan documents.

## Objective
The goal is to develop an automated system that uses a large language model (LLM) to classify English prompts as having proper or improper grammar and spelling. The system is designed for internal use and does not require human review in its workflow.

## Data
The system uses the JFLEG dataset, which contains English sentences annotated for grammar and spelling. The dataset is balanced with an equal number of positive (proper) and negative (improper) examples, and no data augmentation is performed.

## Data Splitting
Data is split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to ensure class balance. The majority of data is used for training, with smaller portions reserved for validation and final testing.

## Model
A DistilBERT model is fine-tuned for binary classification of prompts. The model architecture and training process leverage the HuggingFace Transformers library, and performance is tracked using standard classification metrics.

## Training
Training is performed on class-balanced batches, with metrics monitored on a validation set. Confidence scores are analyzed to determine an appropriate threshold for classifying prompts.

## API
The system exposes a simple API endpoint that accepts a prompt and returns a binary classification (proper/improper) along with a confidence score. The API is designed for easy integration with internal tools.

## Deployment
The service is deployed as a systemd service for reliability and automatic restarts. It is accessible only from a secure bastion host, and all logs are monitored locally.

## Evaluation
Evaluation is conducted using command-line scripts and a held-out test set. Results are logged and include standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Security & Scaling
No authentication or rate limiting is required, as the service is for internal use only. The system is deployed as a single instance, with no current plans for scaling or model updates.

## Future Considerations
Retraining and redeployment are supported if new data becomes available. There are no current plans for multi-language support or extensibility beyond the current English-only setup.
