# Data Splitting
- Stratified split to ensure balanced classes in each set.
    - Use sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split with stratify parameter.
    - Maintain equal proportion of positive and negative examples in train, validation, and test sets.
- **Training:** ~80% of data
    - Used for model fitting and learning parameters.
    - Data is shuffled before each epoch.
- **Validation:** ~10% of data
    - Used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.
    - Not used in training or test evaluation.
- **Test:** ~10% of data
    - Held out until final evaluation.
    - Used to report final metrics and ensure no data leakage.
