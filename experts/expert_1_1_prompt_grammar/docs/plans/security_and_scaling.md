# Security & Scaling
- No authentication or rate limiting required (internal use only).
    - All API endpoints are accessible without authentication headers or tokens.
    - No user or API key management logic is implemented.
    - All requests are trusted as coming from internal, controlled sources.
- No immediate plans for scaling or model updates; single deployment solution.
    - The service is deployed as a single instance on a dedicated VM or container.
    - No load balancing, sharding, or horizontal scaling logic is present.
    - Model files are loaded at startup and not hot-swapped or updated during runtime.
    - Any future scaling or update logic would require a new deployment pipeline and is not anticipated in the current design.
