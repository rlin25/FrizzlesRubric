# Future Considerations
- If needed, retrain and redeploy with new data.
    - Monitor for data drift or changes in prompt grammar usage patterns.
    - Prepare scripts for periodic data collection and retraining.
    - Retraining involves repeating the data preparation, training, and deployment steps.
    - Redeployment is performed by replacing the model checkpoint and restarting the service.
- No plans for multi-language or extensibility at this time.
    - All logic, data processing, and model architecture are English-specific.
    - No support for language detection, translation, or multi-language datasets.
    - Any future extensibility would require a redesign of the data pipeline and model training process.
