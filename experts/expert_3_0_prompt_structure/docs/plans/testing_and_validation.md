# Testing and Validation Plan

## Manual Testing
- Test the system with edge cases, including rare file types and ambiguous prompts.

## Automated Testing
- Implement automated tests for API endpoints (if applicable).
- Validate the model on a held-out test set to estimate real-world performance.

## Special Cases
- Test with both very short and very long prompts to ensure robustness.
