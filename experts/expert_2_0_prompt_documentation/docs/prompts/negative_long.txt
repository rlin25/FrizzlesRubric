Generate 100 examples of developer commands that might be entered into an AI-assisted IDE like Cursor AI to edit or improve code. The commands should be natural and typical of what a developer might say, e.g. "Refactor this function to use list comprehensions" or "Add error handling for null inputs".

They must also be long ( multiple sentences ) and be extremely poorly documented. This means that the primary objective must be jumbled up with smaller, subtasks before being entered into the IDE. Each subtask should be either labeled with a confusing, nonsequential number, or not be labeled at all.

Each example must be completely unique from the others in terms of wording and sentence structure. It's ok to make some shorter or longer than others. You may not synthetically generate any examples whatsoever. Each one must be generated by the LLM.

Give me the results as a downloadable CSV for each set of 20. The CSV should have two fields: prompt and label. The label should be 0 for each line.
