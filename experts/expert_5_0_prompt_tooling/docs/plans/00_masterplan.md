# Masterplan: Expert 5 - Tooling Implementation (Cursor AI)

1. Define the API contract for the expert, including endpoint, request/response schema, and error handling requirements.
2. Specify and document the list of AI/LLM/tooling keywords and phrases to be detected in prompts, and ensure extensibility.
3. Implement the core detection logic as a standalone, testable function/module, with logging and configuration support.
4. Integrate the detection logic into a FastAPI web API, including input validation, error handling, and health check endpoint.
5. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the detection logic and API endpoints, covering edge cases and error scenarios.
6. Provide deployment and operational documentation, including local run instructions, Dockerfile, and health check usage.
7. Establish maintainability guidelines, including updating the keyword list, extending detection logic, and monitoring best practices.
