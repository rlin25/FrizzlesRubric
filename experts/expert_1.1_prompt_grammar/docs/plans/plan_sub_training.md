# Training Plan

## Overview
This document details the training methodology for the Expert 1.1 Prompt Grammar Checker.

## Training Specifications

### Loss Function
- Binary Cross-Entropy with optional class weighting to balance classes

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score on validation and test sets

### Training Process
- Monitor validation F1 for model selection
- Implement early stopping
- Use class weights to handle imbalanced data

## Implementation Tasks
1. Set up training pipeline
2. Implement loss function with class weighting
3. Create evaluation metrics tracking
4. Develop early stopping mechanism
5. Set up model checkpointing
6. Implement training logging
7. Create training visualization tools
